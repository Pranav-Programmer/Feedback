## Getting Started

### Dependencies

This web app does not have any external dependencies. It only uses HTML and CSS for its functionality and styling.

### Setup

Since this web app primarily consists of static HTML and CSS files, there is no specific setup required. Simply host the HTML file on a web server or open it directly in a web browser to start using the feedback form.

### Server-side Handling

The form in this web app submits data to the following server-side script or API endpoint: 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyvQA7RgV14CgCsR9E113f9_AbWT8CWwM38RDp7MDtmoNAREwp9P-FrjaW5z1PO3XsDAA/exec'. This endpoint is responsible for processing the submitted data and storing it or performing any necessary actions.

Please note that the server-side script or API endpoint is not provided in this repository, and you will need to set up your own endpoint or script to handle the form submissions.
